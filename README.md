# Go Product Search API

## Warning Before Running this code
    - This Code Generates 1 Million Random Data and its CPU Intensive.
    - The Generated Results are completely stored in RAM and indexed in RAM too.
    - This is not recommended to run if you are running on 16GB RAM or Below
    - This is **not a project**. This is just a emulation on how the search happens if there are larger number of data (eg. 1M). 
    - If you need to see outputs, head to `sample/`
    - You wanna see the decisions I made checkout `decisionlog.md`

    `ps: if you really wanna run this in a low speced pc/lap even reading after this dont blame me for the consequences. you are given a heads up already.`
